Escape Road Game 🚗💨

Welcome to the Escape Road Game, a fun web-based Unity project!

🌟 About This Project

This is an interactive browser game built with HTML5 and Unity WebGL. I was really inspired by someone else's awesome work to start this project and create my own version. It has been a super fun learning experience putting this together!

🛠️ Feel Free to Experiment!

This project is totally open for you to play around with! You are completely free to experiment with the code, change how things look, or try adding your own cool new ideas. Whether you just want to tweak the HTML or see how a Unity WebGL game connects to a webpage, go ahead and make it your own!

🚀 How to Run

Download all the project files to your computer.

Double-click the index.html file to open it in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).

Wait a moment for the Unity loading bar to finish, and enjoy!
